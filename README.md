# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a funtional 'Work Day Schedular'. The application allows the user to store events for each hour of a typical work day (9 am - 5 pm). These events should persist even after the page has been refreshed. When the page is loaded, the user is met by the current date and empty time blocks that will store any information the user provides. This application features HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
